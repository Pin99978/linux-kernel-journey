what would be printed as result of  the following call to show_bytes?

const char *m = "mnopqr";

show_bytes((byte_pointer) m , strlen(m)));

#### note that letters 'a' through 'z' have ASCII 0x61 -> 0x7A

solution :
strlen(m) = 6
'm' = 'a' + 12 = 0x61 + 12 = 0x6d;
6d 6e 6f 70 71 72

-> my computer is little endian
72 71 70 6f 6e 6d
